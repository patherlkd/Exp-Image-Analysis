# Exp-Image-Analysis
A python toolkit to generate simple workflows to extract features in images generated using AFM e.g.

(This was done as an extra-curricular venture, and further refinements will be made but it works as is. Please do play around with it.)

## Example_workflow.py
Contains example uses of the functions and a workflow for analysing images from experiments.

## py_image_LD.py

Contains functions to manipulate and probe the images.

## cluster.py

Contains the functions to cluster and segment objects.

## Grahams_scan.py

Performs a Grahams scan for convex hull.

## Alpha_shapes.py

Simple use of alpha shapes for the concave hull.
